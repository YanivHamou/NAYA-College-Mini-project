# NAYA-College-Mini-project
Mini-project #1 – Python Programming NAYA – Data Scientist Professional – November 2016 Background Terminology This project is concerned with the implementation of mathematical graphs and their usages. The basic definition of a graph is a set of nodes where some pairs of nodes are connected by edges, and where these edges have weights. Each edge of the graph has a direction so by default a graph is directional. If there is an edge directed from node A to node B, then we say that B is a neighbor of A, and we note that this does not necessarily mean that A is a neighbor of B. However, if all the edges come in “pairs” (namely, if X is a neighbor of Y, then Y is also a neighbor of X), then we say that the graph is non-directional. If it is possible to “travel” from a node A to node B (either directly or through any number of consecutive neighbors), then we say that B is reachable from A and that there is a path connecting A to B. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of the edges from which the path is made of
